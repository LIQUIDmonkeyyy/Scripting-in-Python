# Scripting-in-Python
Author: Ali Rafiei

Notes:
 - mouseposition.py is just a quick tool to find the position of your mouse curser
 - cookie clicker files are practice programs to introduce scripting
 - formfiller2.py is most likely easier to use, feel free to adjust time.sleep to the speed of your computer
